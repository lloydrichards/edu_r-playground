# edu_r-playground

This is a repository for educational purposes. It is a playground for learning
and experimenting with R.

## Getting Started

You will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You can
download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can
download RStudio from the
[RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To get R to run in VSCode, you will need to install languageserver in R. Open
RStudio and run the following command:

```R
install.packages("languageserver")
```

Then, you will need to install the
[R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r)
for Visual Studio Code.

To give it a try, open the `main.r` file, open an R console by
`SHIFT + CMD + P` and typing **R: Create R terminal**. Then, you can run the
code in the file by selecting the code and pressing `CMD + ENTER`.
